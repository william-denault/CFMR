A complete CFMR pipeline with random splits is provided in the folder
CFMR\_pipeline\_code.

## Cross-fitted instrument and Cross-fitting for Mendelian Randomization

Here we present basic scripts to obtain a cross-fitted instrument. For
the sake of simplicity, we donâ€™t partition the data at random.

### A basic example

Here we define the parameters of our analysis

``` r
# n number of individuals
n <- 3000
# p  Number of selected SNPs
p <- 100 
# np_act Number of SNPs affecting the exposure among the p selected SNPs
np_act <-5
# sub_split Number of splits
sub_split <- 5 
```

Below we simulate the data. G contains the selected SNPs (p) and the
(np\_act) first columns of G contain the actual causal SNPs. X and Y are
sampled with correlated noise (0.7) and H is the hidden confounded

``` r
set.seed(1)
#Y and X are sample with some correlated noise
noise <-rmvnorm(n, mean = rep(0, 2), sigma = matrix(nrow = 2,
                                                    byrow = TRUE,
                                                    c(1,0.7,0.7,1) 
                                                    ) 
                )                    
#Genotype data, each of the SNP are sample at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a MAF of 30%
  G <- matrix(sample(c(0,1,2),
                     size= (n*p),
                     prob = c(0.7^2, 2*0.7*0.3, 0.3^2),
                     replace = TRUE),
              nrow= n)          
#Hidden confounding, increase sd to increase confounding
H <- rnorm(n, sd=1)
 
#ZPI is the part of X explained by the SNPs
ZPI <- 0.5*apply( G[, (1:np_act)],1, mean )
 
#X is compound of ZPI, H hidden confounding, and a noise that correlates with the noise of Y
X <- ZPI+H+ noise[,2]
#Y the exposure also affected by H
Y <- X+H+noise[,1] #Effect of X on Y is 1
cor(H,X)
```

    ## [1] 0.6932508

``` r
cor(H,Y) # large confouding
```

    ## [1] 0.7237769

``` r
plot(X,Y,
     main="Bivariate plot of X and Y")

res0 <- lm(Y~X)
abline(a=0,b=summary(res0)$coef[2,1], col="blue", lwd=2)
abline(a=0,b=1, col="green", lwd=4, lty=2)
legend( x=-5, y=7,
        bty = "n",
        lty= c(1,1,1,2),
        legend=c("Confouded estimate" , "Truth"),
        col= c("blue","green"),
        lwd=rep(2,4))
```

The plot above shows the observational association (blue line) between X
and Y. It is is heavily confounded by the hidden confounder H as the
correlation between H and X is 0.69, and the correlation between H and Y
is 0.72. The blue dashed line represent the true effect of X on Y.

### Cross-fitting function

Below the function used to obtain a cross-fitted instrument

``` r
#function to perform the cross fitting
build_IV_sub_sample <- function(i) #i in 0:(sub_split-1)
{
  indx <- (1+i*(n/sub_split)):((i+1)*(n/sub_split))# here the splits are not random
  Gtemp <- G[-indx,]
  Xtemp <- X[-indx]
  lasso <-  cv.glmnet(x=Gtemp, y=Xtemp,alpha=1)
  return(predict(lasso, G[indx,], s = "lambda.min")
  )
}
```

Here we estimate the effect of X on Y using three approaches, a naive
linear model, a one-sample instrument based on LASSO, and a cross-fitted
instrument based on LASSO.

``` r
###Standard linear model
res0 <- lm(Y~X)

#Identification and estimation of the insturement within the sample
lasso <-  cv.glmnet(x=G,y=X,alpha=1)

IV <-  predict(lasso,G,s = "lambda.min")
res1 <- ivreg(Y~X|IV)

# CFI estimation
res  <- lapply(0:(sub_split-1), build_IV_sub_sample)#performing cross-fitting
CFI <- do.call(c,res)
#cross fitted IV, CFMR2
res2 <- ivreg(Y~X|CFI)


plot(X,Y, main="Estimation of the effect of X on Y")
abline(a=0,b=summary(res0)$coef[2,1], col="blue", lwd=2)
abline(a=0,b=summary(res1)$coef[2,1], col="red", lwd=2)
abline(a=0,b=summary(res2)$coef[2,1], col="green", lwd=2)
abline(a=0,b=1, col="green", lwd=4, lty=2)
legend( x=-5, y=7,
        bty = "n",
        lty= c(1,1,1,2),
        legend=c("Linear model", "One sample instrument LASSO","CFI with LASSO" , "Truth"),
        col= c("blue", "red","green", "green"),
        lwd=rep(2,4))
```

The plot above shows the estimates of the effect of X on Y using
different appraoches. CFI with LASSO (solid green line) is the closest
to the true effect of X on Y. One sample instrument with LASSO (solid
red line) is biased towards the confounded estimate based on linear
model (solid blue line).

### Some larger simulations

Here we simulate 3000 data sets and on each of them wethe effect of X on
Y (simulation parameters n=2000, p=100, np\_act=5,beta=0.08,h2=0.1)
using CFI, one sample instrument LASSO estimate, and a standard linear
model. The function used for the simulations can be found at the end of
this document or in the folder CFMR\_simulation\_code.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Clearly, LM and one sample IV Lasso are overconfident and biased. In the
plot below, we see that the linear model and On sample instrument LASSO
have smaller standard errors than CFI with LASSO, which implies
overconfidence in the significance of the estimated
effect.
